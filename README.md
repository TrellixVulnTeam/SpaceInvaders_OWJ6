# Space-Invaders-Game
This Space Invaders game was made in python using pygame. It was one of my first introductory projects into python, learning how to properly use outside libraries such as pygame and correctly use any functions available to create a Space Invaders Game. This project combined learning how screens actually work in the way they might display something, with hidden componenets the user would not see but is there.
