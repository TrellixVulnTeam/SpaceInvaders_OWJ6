# Space-Invaders-Game
This Space Invaders game was made in python using pygame. It was one of my first introductory projects into python, learning how to properly use outside libraries such as pygame and correctly use any functions available to create a Space Invaders Game. This project combined learning how screens actually work in the way they might display something, with hidden componenets the user would not see but is there. 
 
# Running the project
To run this project, just run main.py to open the game.
 
# Project functionality
This game creates a player spaceship that has 5 lives in total, that displays a health bar for the spaceship, and also allows the spaceship to attack with its own lasers using the spacebar, and w a s d to move. There are incoming enemy spaceships that shoot at random intervals that spawn off screen but slowly start displaying at the top of the screen, moving down constantly, with the player losing a life if a spaceship makes it all the way to the end.
